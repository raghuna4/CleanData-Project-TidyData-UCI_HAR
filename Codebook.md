The tidy data set consists of a subset of the fields from the ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). 

### Original Study Design

The UCI HAR data set, upon which our study is based, contains the following description of how the original study was conducted (from the readme.txt provided with the data set):

> The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

> The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

### The current Tidy Data Study Design

#### Assignment 1 of the Project : Combining the original data set into one data.frame
We downloaded the UCI HAR data set on 2015-03-22. The dataset is assembled into one data frame, since it was spread over a number of .txt files. We combined the subjects, the observations, and the list of activities [using the files subject_*.txt, X_*.txt, and y_*.txt] into a single data.frame, then applied the column names and factored the activity column using the provided activity labels in the features.txt and activity_labels.txt files. We repeated this for both the train and test subsets and then combined the subsets into a final data.frame.

Thus produced is a data set with the characterics :
  * Each observation is in a single row 
  * Each variable is in a single column
  * The train and test sets are subsets of the same kind of data and are combined into one table
  These characteristics conform with some requirements of a Tidy Dataset.

#### Assignment 2 of the Project : Removing some columns
To produce the designated subset of only mean and standard deviation variables, all the columns without -std or -mean in the original name are removed. This method deliberately excludes a number of columns with 'mean' in the name because they are not actually mean values. This includes variables containing "meanFreq" and the variables which begin with "angle." The subject and activity columns are retained for matching.

#### Assignments 3 & 4 of the Project : Tidying up the column names
The metrics column names are renamed into more descriptive and human readable ones. The codebook contains a mapping of new variable names to old variable names.

* The prefixes 't' and 'f'  have been replaced with 'time' and 'frequency' respectively to the readers convenience to keep track of the physical quantity they signify.
  * integer. 1 to 30. The identifier of the study subject.
* Non-semantic special characters like "(", ")", etc., are removed.
* Removed duplicate phrases in variable names. eg. 'BodyBody' becomes 'Body'
* Columns names have been converted to lower case as is common in tidy data.
* Long Column names are punctuated with periods to make them human readable and descriptive. Periods in variable names are legal and common in R practice. 
  - eg. "mean.frequency.bodyacc.std.x" vs meanfrequencybodyaccstdx"
* Since the columns in the tidy data set represent the mean of each variable (See the 'Summarizing the data' section below), we have also prefixed the column names with "mean."

#### Assignment 5 of the Project : Summarizing the data in a new data.frame
In a new data.frame, the data is summarized by subject and activity, with the mean of each metric is stored.

### 
The UCI HAR data set's codebook (features_info.txt) describes the original variables as:

> The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

> Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

> Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

> These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
